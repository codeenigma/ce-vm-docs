## Vhosts

A default configuration is generated based on the type of project (Drupal, Symfony, â€¦) and the 'webroot' defined in your config.yml

It will by default listen on port 80 and 443. Note that the SSL vhost uses a self-signed certificate, so you will need to add an exception in your browser.
