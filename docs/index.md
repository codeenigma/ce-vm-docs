**ce-vm: web development stack**

Spins up a LAMP environment using Docker containers, managed and orchestrated with Vagrant.

It will generate ready-made codebase and suitable settings for either:

- Drupal
- Symfony
- Wordpress

but can be used for any other kind of php based web app.

It aims to be both:

1. Easy to use: it should work out the box for standard configurations.
2. Flexible: everything is overridable and extendable using Ansible, for more advanced setups.
